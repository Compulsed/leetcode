# Stack

## Key Techniques
- **Reverse Polish Notation**: Operands push, operators pop two and push result
- **Monotonic Stack**: Maintain increasing/decreasing order for next greater/smaller
- **Parentheses Matching**: Push open, pop and match on close

## Tips
- Stack is LIFO - good for nested structures and backtracking
- Often paired with recursion problems (call stack)
