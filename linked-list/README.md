# Linked List

## Key Techniques
- **Floyd's Cycle Detection**: Slow/fast pointers, O(1) space
- **Hash Set**: Track seen nodes for cycle detection, O(n) space
- **Reverse**: Iterative (in-place) or recursive with accumulator

## Tips
- Iterative solutions are often more space efficient than recursive
- For cycle detection, Floyd's algorithm avoids extra space
- Draw out pointer movements before coding
